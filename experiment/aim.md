## Aim of the Experiment

- The objective of Part 1 of the experiment is to fully understand the functionality of 4 bit magnitude comparator using 7485 IC and to show how the comparator output changes according to input combinations of two 4 bit binary numbers.
- The objective of Part 2 of the experiment is to understand the functionality of 8bit magnitude comparator by cascading two four bit magnitude comparator.
